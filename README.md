An interactive frontend-only simulation demonstrating how railway collisions can be prevented using sensors, braking logic, and physics-based calculations.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with smooth SVG animations.

Features:

-->Adjust Speed, Obstacle Distance & Sensor Delay

-->Real-time SVG Train Animation

-->Virtual Sensor Detection System

-->Accurate Physics-Based Calculations

-->Stopping Distance

-->Collision Checks

-->Auto-Braking Time

-->Collision Warning System

-->Live Dashboard (Speed, distance, status updates)

How It Works:

The simulator calculates:
  --> stoppingDistance = (speed^2) / (2 * deceleration)
